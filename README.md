# internship-Projects
A web Project / truss solver (matlab/python)




# Web Prokect 
-> Put in mind that project works with python FastApi so if you need to run this project you'll:
1-Install FastAPI  https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/
2-Install uvicorn  https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/
2-enter to server/src and than type in the consle "python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload" to launch the project 
->If you do not want to work with these way so you can enter to source files and edit the fetch just decomment the old fetch (there is 2)
and comment the current one but now you will using a free host api maybe it dosen't work with time cycle!
